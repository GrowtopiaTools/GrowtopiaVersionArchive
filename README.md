# GrowtopiaVersionArchive

An attempt at archiving the GrowtopiaInstaller.exe files for all Growtopia versions.

### How to install

To install individual versions, click the file and then click 'View raw'.

### Motivation

It might seem weird to archive older Growtopia versions since the servers don't allow players using older versions. I still think it is important to archive though, because Ubisoft can at any point release an update that ruins the client.

Most private servers don't implement a version check too, so if there are any old client features you like, you will still be able to play on private servers with them.

It might also be interesting to reverse engineer and find differences between versions or hidden features in older versions. 

### Where they are found

The newest version can always be found at `https://growtopiagame.com/Growtopia-Installer.exe`

Most versions from 2.71 and up can be found at `http://cdn.growtopiagame.com/VERSION/GrowtopiaInstaller.exe`

Some can also be found at `http://ubistatic-a.akamaihd.net/0098/CDNContentXX/GrowtopiaInstaller.exe` where `XX` is any 2-digit number. Not all of these links work and many point to the same file.

Lastly, there are a few links that replace the CDNContent path from the previous example with a 5-digit number. These include:

* `https://ubistatic-a.akamaihd.net/0098/87609/GrowtopiaInstaller.exe`
* `https://ubistatic-a.akamaihd.net/0098/65286/GrowtopiaInstaller.exe`
* `https://ubistatic-a.akamaihd.net/0098/59372/GrowtopiaInstaller.exe`

It is unknown how many of these links exist since it is rather difficult to bruteforce.
